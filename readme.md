Technologies I used to make this project was HTML, Javascript and CSS. I also used my Macbook, listened to Spotify as I coded, used the internets to look up solutions to questions I was having & watched Youtube videos for more help.

The approach I took was "Damn, I hope this works", then trying it and seeing if it worked or not.  I did a lot of trial and error.

The unsolved problems I had was when all the cards matched I wanted the timer to reload automatically when you won. I also wanted the board to reload when the timer ran out, so both being reload/reshuffle related.

- 18 tiles with GIF images on one side.
- Each GIF appears on 2 tiles
- Game starts with all tiles turned down
- Player flips over 2 tiles by clicking them.
- If 2 tiles have matching images they remain flipped.
- Otherwise tiles flip back down after small period of time (half a second?)
- Goal to get all tiles matched and facing up.
